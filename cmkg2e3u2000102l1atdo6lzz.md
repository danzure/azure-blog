The new year for a lot of us marks the start of something new, something we want to improve on or achieve in the year ahead, whether that's the diet you start every year or something else entirely. So in keeping with the spirit of starting that self-improvement journey for this month's (long overdue) blog entry, I’ve decided to take a break from my [A-Z of Azure series](https://a-z-ure.blog/series/a-z-of-azure). Instead. I want to cover the ‘*How to..*’ of Microsoft Certifications: what are they and how do you get certified.

What inspired this? Well, over the past month (or two), I’ve slowly been working towards expanding my own certification collection. With the New Year here, many of you will be wanting that new job or perhaps going for a promotion, so I figured, what better time to put something like this together? While Microsoft themselves have an assortment of resources and information regarding ‘Getting Certified’, I wanted to try to break it down and simplify the information from my experience. This guide is for those of you who are perhaps new to the certification process, or perhaps those wanting to break into their first cloud-based or IT engineering role.

## Why get Microsoft Certified?

You can read up on Microsoft’s learn page on ‘[Why getting certified?](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/posts/microsoft-learn-why-get-certified)’ is important. These reasons include career progression and boosts to salary that are great in the long term, especially if you progress into the more advanced ‘Associate’ and ‘Expert’ level certifications (more on those later). However, if you are new to the IT industry or wanting to pivot into the cloud space, getting a Microsoft certification—even if it’s just the fundamental level exams—can be a great way to stand out to future employers or even current ones.

Speaking from experience, I’m not sure I’d be where I am today without the **AZ-900: Azure Fundamentals**. Taking that exam was the catalyst for my cloud transition; the material was fresh, interesting, and I genuinely enjoyed learning something completely new.

## What are Microsoft Certifications?

Now, if you are sat there thinking, “Great, but I still don’t know what they are,” well let’s break it down. First and foremost, Microsoft credentials are essentially an industry-recognised certificate that validates your level of knowledge and understanding in a given topic area. For the purpose of this blog series, I’ll keep the focus on Azure, but there are a number of other Microsoft technologies you can become certified in, from Azure to Power Platform or even Microsoft Dynamics.

However, there is a slight twist. There are two types of credentials that Microsoft offer. The main certification of the two—the one you will see across professional social media sites—are the ‘full’ Microsoft Certifications. Think **AZ-900: Azure Fundamentals** or **AZ-104: Azure Administrator** if you are familiar with those. If not, you can see the complete certification list by visiting the [Become Microsoft Certified](https://arch-center.azureedge.net/Credentials/Certification-Poster_en-us.pdf) poster page for the complete collection.

The other type of credential that Microsoft offer is the [Microsoft Applied Skills](https://arch-center.azureedge.net/Credentials/microsoft-applied-skills-poster.pdf), These are a relatively new type of credential tailored towards practical, hands-on learning as a way to validate skills before taking the full certification exams mentioned above. They’re not proctored (meaning they’re not monitored by an invigilator) like the primary certification exams are, as they are generally aimed towards students, educators, or those looking to change careers. We won’t cover them in much detail here, but it’s important to know they exist as they can be a great way to get some hands-on experience.

### Breaking down the different certifications

You might have noticed that all of the Microsoft certifications from the [Become Microsoft Certified](https://arch-center.azureedge.net/Credentials/Certification-Poster_en-us.pdf) poster are broken up into different categories, these are as follows:

**Fundamentals** - These are going to be as the name suggests, the entry level certifications. If you are new to the Microsoft Cloud, these are an excellent place to start your certification journey. These certifications are designed to help provide you with a high-level overview of the technologies covered with a base level of understanding, these do not require any prior knowledge or experience.

Tip: *While the Fundamentals are completely optional, in my opinion they’re absolutely worth doing. They don’t require any sort of renewal process so once you have them you keep them for life and they look excellent on a CV*

**Role-Based** – The next step up from the Fundamentals are the **Role-Based** certifications. These are split into two distinct tiers: Associate and Expert.

* **Associate** – These are your ‘*Intermediate*’ level exams. They test your practical, hands-on knowledge of the tools and services covered in the fundamental exams. It is generally recommended that you have **at least six months** of hands-on experience before attempting these exams but I would personally recommend around twelve months with a good amount of hands-on exposure.
    
* **Expert** – These are your ‘*Advanced*’ level exams. They test your ability to translate practical skills into high-level technical designs, aligning them with business requirements. The focus shifts heavily towards areas such as cost vs. performance, redundancy, and security. It is recommended that you have around 2 - 3 years of experience before taking these exams. Most if not all Expert level certifications generally have a requirement that you must have an associate level certification before you earn the expert level. For example the AZ-305 (Azure Expert) you must hold the AZ-104 certification, taking the AZ-305 on its own will not grant you the Azure Expert certification.
    

**Speciality** - As the name suggests, these certifications are focused on specific use cases or solutions within the Microsoft cloud for those who want to focus on a particular technology such as solutions like Azure AZ-140 - Azure Virtual Desktop (AVD)

**Business** - These are completely new and have only been introduced as of November 2025 and are at time of writing still in beta and are certifications aimed towards business professionals for AI tools in areas like Marketing, Project Management or Customer Service for productivity and insights.

## How Do You Get Certified?

So, we know what Microsoft Certifications are and what some of the benefits are but how do you actually get certified? Well remember the [Become Microsoft Certified](https://arch-center.azureedge.net/Credentials/Certification-Poster_en-us.pdf) poster? well, it starts once you’ve selected the certification path you want to take. Each certification in the poster has an embedded link to the certification page where it will cover all the details and information of that exam so If you’re entirely new to cloud, then start with the fundamentals. Interested in Security? then go look at the SC-900: Security, Compliance and Identity Fundamentals or for Azure it’s AZ-900: Azure Fundamentals. Whatever your path or career goals, there is a certification relevant to you.

Once you’ve chosen a path or an exam you want to take, this is where you’ll need to put the work in towards that certification. Unfortunately, I can’t do the studying for you but what I can do is help you break it down into three key stages: Study, Practice and Exam.

### Stage 1: The Study Process

For most certifications there are a lot of resources you can use, both official (material provided by Microsoft) and non-official (material provided by third parties) and within that, the resources then fall into three different categories. I personally use a combination of all three as this is what works for me, but you might learn differently but these are as follows:

* **Microsoft Learn:** This is your foundation. It's Microsoft's own free learning platform, offering structured, self-paced modules for every exam on offer. The content is always aligned with the latest updates to the exam material and consists typically of written materials with some ‘try-this’ style exercises.
    
* **Video Courses:** As the name suggests, these are generally full video series on the course material with demos and visuals to help you learn. You can use reputable platforms like **Udemy** or **Pluralsight**, that are great for east to digest even on the commute to work every morning. I recommended going with instructors or courses from high rated trainers such as **Scott Duffy** or [John Savill](https://www.youtube.com/@NTFAQGuy) on **YouTube** who offers great study crams across a number of Microsoft certifications.
    
* [Hands-on Labs:](https://www.youtube.com/@NTFAQGuy) If you're like me, I generally learn more by ‘doing something’ rather than just reading about it so rather than just reading how to create an Azure Virtual Desktop, go create one and try to connect it and use it. As someone who has worked in Azure for four, going on five years hands-on experience is crucial especially if you want to tackle those Associate and Expert level certifications, I created a guide in my [Getting Started with Azure](https://a-z-ure.blog/g-is-for-getting-started-with-azure) on how to setup your own subscription for practice at home without breaking the bank.
    

### Stage 2: Practice Exams

I would always advise especially if you have never done a Microsoft certification exam before to practice the types of questions you’ll get in your full exam. While they’re not designed to trick you, they are designed to test your knowledge especially on Associate and Expert level exams where a pass could be the difference between knowing the Azure services that offer regional failover and those that don’t for a particular scenario.

There are a good variety of sites and third-party platforms that offer practice exams, some of the courses on [**Udemy**](https://udemy.com) that we discussed earlier even include their own set of practice exam questions but the ones that I would recommend personally are:

**Microsoft Practice Exams (Official) -** For each certification Microsoft offer, under each exam there is ‘**Prepare for the exam**’ section that will take you towards the bottom of the page where you can take a practice assessment as shown in the screenshots below

**TutorialsDojo (Non-official)** - [TutorialsDojo](https://portal.tutorialsdojo.com/) is third-party platform that offers exam-like practice questions as you would in your actual Microsoft exam in a course like format. These are paid courses for around £10 each give or take but having used this site for all my certifications so far, it’s been incredibly helpful and provides clear guidance throughout your practice exams why your answers might be right or wrong with links to official Microsoft Learn documentation.

Whatever platform you use, It’s important to go through these practice tests to ensure that there are no gaps in your knowledge, if you do find a topic area that you are struggling with, go back and do some further study in that area until you feel your more comfortable, there is nothing worse than getting to a question in your actual exam and having completely forgotten about that specific topic (don’t ask me how I know) as that one topic could be the difference between a pass or fail so make sure your score across the different topic areas is as balanced, this will give you the best chances in the exam.

Exam Tip: *For the actual certification exam (Applies only to Associate and Expert level certifications) you do have access to Microsoft Learn (Open Book) however any time spent here is used up against your exam time so don’t spend ages looking for information, otherwise you might miss out on answering all the questions or have to rush towards the end leaving marks on the table that you do know. Instead, what I have found works well is to flag or mark ‘🚩’ any questions you are unsure of for reviewing at the end of the test. Then using any time you have left, to search for that information to confirm those questions.*

Each exam study practice platform will have its own recommended threshold; on the official Microsoft practice tests they recommend aiming for a consistent 80% (A pass is 70% in the actual exam) but TutorialsDojo has the threshold at 70% but from my experience if during your practice exams you are getting between 70 -80% pretty consistently then you are ready to take your exam.

### Stage 3: Booking your exam

***Note:*** *I would recommend booking your exam as soon as possible after studying. Don’t do all of your studies and practice then wait something like 8+ weeks for your exam, book the exam as close together as possible. Even if you are getting 65%-75% in your practice exams book the exam a few weeks in advance and by the time the exam appointment rolls around you should be up to that 70%-80% practice mark or alternatively book the exam at the start of your studies and work towards that date. Don’t worry if you get close to your exam date and don’t feel ready, you can reschedule your exam as long as it’s done 24+ hours in advance of the date/ time of your appointment.*

So, you’ve done all your studying and now you're ready to take the exam but how do you schedule it? Well, if you haven’t already done so then the first step is setup your [Microsoft Learn Profile](https://learn.microsoft.com/profile) as you cannot take any exam without one, I covered the process on how to do this on [Getting started with Azure](https://a-z-ure.blog/g-is-for-getting-started-with-azure#heading-so-how-do-i-start), if you have done this step then head to the certification exam page of your choice, in this example we’ll use the [AZ-900: Azure Fundamentals](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/credentials/certifications/azure-fundamentals/?WT.mc_id=certposter_poster-wwl&practice-assessment-type=certification). From the exam page, scroll down until you find the ‘Schedule exam’ section as per the screenshot below.

***Note***\*: Exam prices will vary depending on region and level, a typical range is around\* £64 - £106 or your regional equivalent at the time of writing with role-based exams on the higher end of the scale.

You will then be transferred to the Pearson Vue once you have filled out and submitted the candidate identity page as per the screenshot below.

Once you have been transferred to the Pearson Vue site the first option you will need to choose is where you’re going to take your exam, there are two main options to choose from:

1. **Test centre (In-Person)** - Travel to and take the exam at a dedicated testing centre, operated and managed by PearsonVue.
    
2. **OnVue (Online/ Remote)** - Allows you to take the exam at home or at a remote location in your own space.

## Taking your exam

Depending on what option you chose to take your exam, will depend on the experience. If you chose to take your exam at a test centre, then the process is fairly straightforward. Once you arrive at the test centre the staff on site will guide you through the steps and what you need to do, things like phones will be locked away in lockers that type of thing.

However, if you are taking the exam at home then there are certain requirements and steps you need to do to ensure a space within your home meets those exam requirements otherwise PearsonVue may cancel your exam, you can read the full details on how to setup your space [here](https://www.pearsonvue.com/us/en/microsoft.html) and if this is your first time taking an exam, Microsoft also have a link at the bottom of each certification page where you can [take a practice assessment](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/azure-fundamentals/practice/assessment?assessment-type=practice&assessmentId=23&practice-assessment-type=certification) that will run through a short demo of how the full exam will look.

### Closing thoughts

And there you have it—my breakdown of the what, why, and how of Microsoft Certifications. I hope this post has been helpful to remove some of the mystery and confusion around Microsoft certifications and encourages you to go for that certification (or two), and I wish you all the best of luck for 2026!
